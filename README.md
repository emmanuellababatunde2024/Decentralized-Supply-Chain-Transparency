# 🌍 Decentralized Supply Chain Transparency

Welcome to a revolutionary Web3 project that enhances transparency and trust in global supply chains using the Stacks blockchain and Clarity smart contracts. This project addresses the real-world problem of opaque supply chains, where consumers, regulators, and businesses struggle to verify product origins, authenticity, and ethical sourcing. By leveraging blockchain, we ensure immutable tracking, certification, and verification of goods from source to shelf.

## ✨ Features

- 📦 **Product Registration**: Manufacturers register products with unique identifiers and metadata.
- 🛤️ **Supply Chain Tracking**: Record each step of a product's journey (e.g., production, shipping, distribution).
- ✅ **Authenticity Verification**: Consumers and regulators can verify product authenticity and origin.
- 🌱 **Ethical Sourcing Certification**: Certify products as ethically sourced or sustainable.
- 🔍 **Transparency Queries**: Publicly accessible data for supply chain transparency.
- 🚫 **Conflict-of-Interest Checks**: Prevent fraudulent or duplicate entries using smart contract logic.
- 🔒 **Permissioned Access**: Role-based access for manufacturers, distributors, and auditors.

## 🛠 How It Works

### For Manufacturers
1. Register a product by providing a unique product ID, metadata (e.g., name, origin, batch number), and a hash of associated documents.
2. Record production details, such as materials used and certifications (e.g., organic, fair trade).
3. Update product status as it moves to distributors.

### For Distributors
1. Log receipt and transfer of products, ensuring the chain of custody is maintained.
2. Verify product authenticity before accepting shipments.

### For Consumers/Regulators
1. Query product details using the product ID to view its supply chain history.
2. Verify certifications and authenticity via immutable blockchain records.

### For Auditors
1. Access supply chain data to ensure compliance with regulations or ethical standards.
2. Use conflict-of-interest checks to detect fraudulent or duplicate registrations.
